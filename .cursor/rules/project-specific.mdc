## Golden Rules: Project Integrity

These rules define key aspects of the project that must **never** be violated. Before making changes, ensure all assumptions align with these principles.

### 1. **Do not make up data**  
- This is an **academic project**, meaning all data must originate from a specific, verified source.  
- **Hallucinated or fabricated data is strictly prohibited**â€”the integrity of the research depends on accuracy.  
- **Backup measures are not allowed**: If data retrieval fails, the system must **raise an exception** instead of substituting placeholder values.  
- Every code modification must respect this constraint, ensuring consistency and reproducibility in academic findings.  


Breaking these rules **compromises the integrity** of the project. Always validate your logic against them before proceeding with any changes.
